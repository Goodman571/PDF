Objective of this presentation:

The exploratory data analysis provides immediate value to the clients, as it provides information about how various features are influencing the target variable (in this case the prices of houses).
Furthermore the data visualization generated in this stage can be of use in presentations.
A good EDA is the foundation step of further modeling stages and also has direct impact on the quality of models produced later on.
